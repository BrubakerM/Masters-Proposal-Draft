This is a document in which I can try to develop my story as I move forward. It will also serve to help me stay on track and make sure my thoughts are clear and concise.

__The main gap__ that I am trying to fill is the idea that we do not fully understand how these different forest life stages differ in terms of their functionality. We have determined how microbial communities differ in different biomes and forests as age goes on but we don't have a measurement of how that change in community changes how the forest functions. 
    + maybe it doesnt? Maybe function remains but that would indicate that the community like changed to allow certain microbes to be dominant and thrive in new conditions. 
    + We know that forests change in terms of soil properties, vegitation diversity, and to some extent ecosystem function as they age ~ but for some reason we seem to just assume that all of these different successional stages function the same. 
      - if this is the case, fine, then we need to understand how these new micriobial communities are able to maintain function while so many other parameters are changing. 
      - if this is NOT the case then we need to undertand how forest age changes functionality (fungi/carbon in our case)
      
__Additional gap__ that needs to be filled is this lack of clarity in old growth forests. From definitions to weather or not they are carbon sources/sinks. We need to know the answeres to these questions in order to properly assess them and make decisions in legislature. 
    + how can we argue weather or not an OGF is a carbon source or sink without even understanding how the soil systems differ in functionality?
